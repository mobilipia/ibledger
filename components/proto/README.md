`vega-proto` provides a high-level interface for interacting with code
generated by `protoc-rust` crate.

The central part of this crate is `ProtobufConvert` trait.

The main purpose of this trait is to allow users to create
a map between their types and the types generated from `.proto`
descriptions, while providing a mechanism for additional
validation of Protobuf data.

Most of the time you do not have to implement this trait because most
of the use cases are covered by `#[derive(ProtobufConvert)]`
from `vega_derive` crate.

A typical example of such mapping with validation is manual implementation
of this trait for `vega_crypto::Hash`. `vega_crypto::Hash` is a fixed
sized array of bytes but Protobuf does not allow us to express this
constraint since only dynamically sized arrays are supported.

If you would like to use `Hash` as a part of your Protobuf struct, you would
have to write a conversion function from Protobuf `proto::Hash`(which
is dynamically sized array of bytes) to`vega_crypto::Hash` and call
it every time when you want to use `vega_crypto::Hash` in your application.

The provided `ProtobufConvert` implementation for Hash allows you to embed
this field into your struct and generate `ProtobufConvert` for it using
`#[derive(ProtobufConvert)]`, which will validate your structure based on the
validation function for `Hash`.

Consult [the crate docs](https://docs.rs/vega-proto) for more details.

## Examples

Sample Protobuf roundtrip:

```rust
use vega_proto::ProtobufConvert;
use bit_vec::BitVec;

fn main() {
    let bit_vector = BitVec::from_bytes(&[0b_1010_0000, 0b_0001_0010]);

    let bit_vector_pb = bit_vector.to_pb();
    let deserialized_bit_vector: BitVec = ProtobufConvert::from_pb(pb_bv).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(bit_vector, deserialized_bit_vector);
}
```

## Usage

Include `vega-proto` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
vega-proto = "0.1.0"
```
